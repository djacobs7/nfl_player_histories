Teams since 2005 with the fewest players who started a game:
```{r}
d %>% 
  filter( year > 2005 )%>%
  top_n( 10, -num_starting_players_z ) %>%
  select(winPerc, Tm, year, num_starting_players_z, num_starting_players) %>%
  arrange( desc(winPerc) )
```

Teams since 2005 with few starters, and fewer than 9 wins
```{r}
d %>% 
  filter( year > 2005 )%>%
  top_n( 10, -num_starting_players_z ) %>%
  select(winPerc, Tm, year, num_starting_players_z, num_starting_players) %>%
  arrange( winPerc ) %>%
  filter( winPerc <= 0.5)
```

Teams since 2005 with the most starting players
```{r}
d %>% 
  filter( year > 2005 )%>%
  top_n( 10, num_starting_players_z ) %>%
  select(winPerc, Tm, year, num_starting_players_z, num_starting_players) %>%
  arrange( desc(winPerc) )
```

Teams since 2005 with lots of starters, and more than 8 wins
```{r}
d %>% 
  filter( year > 2005 )%>%
  top_n( 10, num_starting_players_z ) %>%
  select(winPerc, Tm, year, num_starting_players_z, num_starting_players) %>%
  arrange( desc(winPerc) ) %>%
  filter( winPerc > 0.5)

```
```{r}
ggplot( 
  d %>% 
    filter( year > 2005 )%>%
    select( winPerc, Tm, num_starting_players_z , year),
  aes( x = winPerc, y = num_starting_players_z, color = Tm)
  ) +  
    geom_point(color ='black', alpha = 0.2) + 
  geom_point(
    
    data =  d %>% 
      filter( year > 2005 )%>%
      filter( team_abbr == "cle" | team_abbr == "nwe" | team_abbr == "dal") 

    
  )

```


Mean num starting players, by team since 2005
```{r}

d2 =   d %>% 
    filter( year > 2005 )%>%
    select( winPerc, Tm, num_starting_players_z , year, team_abbr) %>%
    group_by( team_abbr ) %>%
    summarize(num_starting_players_z =  mean(num_starting_players_z), winPerc = mean(winPerc), Tm = first(Tm))
ggplot( d2, aes( x = num_starting_players_z , y = winPerc, label = team_abbr ) ) + 
  geom_text()

```

How does a team evolve over time?  In terms of their num starts versus win percentage
```{r}
d2 = d %>% 
  filter( year > 2005 )%>%
  filter( team_abbr == "cle" | team_abbr == "nwe" | team_abbr == "rav") %>%
  arrange( year) %>%
  group_by( team_abbr ) %>%
  select(winPerc, Tm, year, num_starting_players_z, num_starting_players) 
d2
ggplot( d2, aes( x = num_starting_players_z, y = winPerc ,label = year, color = Tm)) +
  geom_text( ) + 
  geom_path() + 
  xlim(c( -2, 2) ) +
    ylim(c(0, 1) ) 

```


We would like to know more about what is up with the patriots having so many starters.

Let's look at their number of starters by position, so we can get some idea.
```{r}
dd = data %>%
  filter( GS > 0 ) %>%
  filter( !is.na( GS ) ) %>%
  mutate( Pos = tolower( Pos)) %>%
  group_by( year,  team_abbr, Pos ) %>%
  summarize( num_starters = n(), meanGS = mean ( GS), max_GS = max (GS), min_GS  = min (GS) ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by( year, Pos ) %>%
  mutate( mean_num_starters = mean( num_starters ), mean_max_GS = mean(max_GS ), mean_min_GS = mean(min_GS )) %>%
  mutate( num_starters_deviation = num_starters - mean_num_starters) %>%
  filter( team_abbr == "nwe" ) %>%
  filter( year == 2013 ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(num_starters_deviation) ) 

dd

dd %>%
  select( year, team_abbr, Pos, num_starters, num_starters_deviation)
```


```{r}
data %>% 
  filter( team_abbr == 'dal', year == 2016 ) %>%
  filter ( GS > 0 ) %>%
  select( Pos , GS, Player ) %>%
  arrange( Pos )


```

In 2013-2015, the Patriots seem to have used a well above average number of running backs 

```{r}


dd =  d %>% 
    joinWithRecordData() %>%
    select( winPerc, Tm, num_starting_players_z , year)

model = lm( winPerc ~ num_starting_players_z, dd  )
summary(model)
```


```{r}

d = data %>% 
     filter ( GS > 0 ) %>%
     filter ( !is.na(GS)) %>%
     mutate( Pos = tolower(Pos)) %>%
     group_by( team_abbr, year, Pos ) %>%
     filter( Pos != "") %>%
     select( Player, team_abbr, year , GS, Pos) %>%
     summarize( num_starting_players = n() ) %>%
     ungroup() %>%
     arrange(num_starting_players ) 

dd =  d %>% group_by( Pos ) %>%
        summarize( m = mean ( num_starting_players) )
dd$Pos =  factor(dd$Pos, levels = dd$Pos[order(dd$m)])


ggplot(dd
        , aes ( x = Pos, y = m)) + 
  geom_bar( stat='identity') + 
  coord_flip()

```

```{r}
d = data %>% 
     filter ( GS > 0 ) %>%
     filter ( !is.na(GS)) %>%
     mutate( Pos = tolower(Pos)) %>%
     group_by( team_abbr, year, Pos ) %>%
     filter( Pos != "") %>%
     select( Player, team_abbr, year , GS, Pos) %>%
     summarize( num_starting_players = n() ) %>%
     ungroup() %>%
     arrange(num_starting_players )  %>%
     group_by(year, Pos) %>%
     mutate( mean_starters = mean ( num_starting_players), 
             sd_starters = sd ( num_starting_players )) %>%
    filter( sd_starters != 0 ) %>%
    mutate( num_starters_z = (num_starting_players - mean_starters) / sd_starters, count = n())  %>%
    filter( count > 30 ) %>%
    ungroup()

dd =  d %>% 
      joinWithRecordData() %>%
      select( winPerc, Tm, num_starters_z , year, Pos) %>%
      filter(!is.na( num_starters_z )) %>%
      spread( Pos, num_starters_z)

#This model didnt work ( too many NAs)
#model = lm( winPerc ~c  +cb + db + de + dt + fb + fs + lb + lcb +  lg + lt + ot + qb  + rb + rcb + rg + rt + ss + te  + wr, dd
#    )


model = lm( winPerc ~ c  + de   + fs  +  lg + lt + qb  + rb + rg + rt + te  + wr , dd )

summary(model)
  
```

These are the top teams that had three or more quarterbacks start in a given year.
```{r}

getNumStartingQbs(data) %>%
        joinWithRecordData() %>%
        ungroup() %>%
        group_by( num_starting_qbs ) %>%
        arrange( desc( winPerc)) %>%
        filter( num_starting_qbs >= 3 ) %>%
        top_n( 5, winPerc)
```


And these are the worst teams with only one starting quarterback

```{r}

getNumStartingQbs(data) %>%
        joinWithRecordData() %>%
        group_by( num_starting_qbs ) %>%
        arrange( ( winPerc)) %>%
        filter( num_starting_qbs <= 2 ) %>%
        top_n( 20, 1.0 - winPerc)
```
